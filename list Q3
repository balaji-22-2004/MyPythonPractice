Imagine you're judging a pie competition. You have scores for each pie in a list, and you want to determine the pie with the highest score (the winner!). Lists in Python can store these scores, and built-in functions can help you efficiently find the maximum value.
Input Format:
A list of integers representing the scores of the pies.
Output Format:
An integer representing the highest score in the list (the winning score).
Sample Input:
85 90 78 92 88
Sample Output:
92

Solution:

list=input().split()
ilist=[]
for i in list:
    ilist.append(int(i))
print(max(ilist))
