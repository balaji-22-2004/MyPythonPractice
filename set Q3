You manage a camping club and want to keep track of its members. You initially create a set to store member names. As new people join the club, you need a way to add them to the existing set.
Input Format:
The first line contains an integer n representing the number of new members to be added.
The next n lines each contain a string representing the name of a new member.
Output Format:
 Print the set of member names after adding all new members.
Sample Input:
3
Alice
Bob
Charlie
Sample Output:
{'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'}

Solution:
n=int(input())
ls=[]
for i in range(n):
    x=input()
    ls.append(x)

s=set(ls)
s2=sorted(s)
print(s2)
