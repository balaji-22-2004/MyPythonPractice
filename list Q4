Imagine you're organizing a palindrome competition, where players submit words or phrases that are the same spelled forward and backward (e.g., "racecar", "level"). You're given a list of entries (strings) from the competition. To determine the number of valid palindromes (length 2 or more, first and last characters same), Python's string manipulation and list iteration techniques come in handy.
Input Format:
A list of strings representing entries from the competition.
Output Format:
An integer representing the number of valid palindromes.
Sample input:
racecar,level,hello,madam,noon
Sample Output:
4

Solution:
list=input().split(",")
count=0
for i in list:
    if(i==i[::-1]):
        count+=1
print(count)
