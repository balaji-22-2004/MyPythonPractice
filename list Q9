Imagine you're a writer working on a children's book. You have a list of words you've brainstormed for the story. You want to identify words that are longer than a certain length (e.g., 3 characters) to ensure they're appropriate for young readers. Lists in Python can store these words, and list comprehension techniques can help you efficiently filter based on word length.
Input Format:
The input consists of two lines:
1)An integer N'  representing the number of words in the list.
2)'N' space-separated strings representing the list of words.
Output Format:
The output consists of a list of words that are longer than a specified length.
Sample Input:
5
cat dog elephant rabbit giraffe
3
Sample Output:
elephant
rabbit
giraffe

Solution:
n=int(input())
ls=input().split()
count=int(input())
newls=[]
for i in ls:
    if(len(i)>count):
        newls.append(i)
print(newls)
