You're a student and want to manage your course schedule for the upcoming semester. You initially create a set containing the courses you're enrolled in. However, due to scheduling conflicts or changes in interest, you might need to remove some courses.
Input Format:
The input will start with an integer n, the number of initial courses.
The next n lines will each contain the name of a course (a string).
The next line will contain an integer m, the number of courses to be removed.
The following m lines will each contain the name of a course to be removed (a string).
Output Format:
The output will be the list of remaining courses, each on a new line, in lexicographical order.
Sample Input:
5
Mathematics
Physics
Chemistry
Biology
History
2
Biology
History
Sample Output:
Chemistry
Mathematics
Physics

Solution:
n=int(input())
ls1=[]
for i in range(n):
    v1=input()
    ls1.append(v1)
m=int(input())
ls2=[]
for i in range(m):
    v2=input()
    ls2.append(v2)
s1=set(ls1)
s2=set(ls2)
d=s1.difference(s2)
sor=sorted(d)
for i in sor:
    print(i)
