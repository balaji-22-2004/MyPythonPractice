Imagine you're a scientist studying different plant species. You have a list containing the names of these species. You want to create a copy of this list for further analysis without modifying the original data. Lists in Python store this kind of information, and copying techniques ensure you can work with a separate version while keeping the original intact.
Input Format:
A list containing the names of plant species.
Output Format:
A new list containing the same names of plant species as the input list.
Sample Input:
Rose,Tulip,Sunflower,Lily,Daisy
Sample Output:
["Rose", "Tulip", "Sunflower", "Lily", "Daisy"]

Solution:
a=input().split(",")
print(a)
