Imagine you're a botanist studying a new plant species. You've identified its key characteristics: name, height range, and bloom color. List in Python are ideal for storing this information in an ordered and mutable way, allowing you to create a clear record of the plant's details.
Input Format:
The input will consist of a single line containing three comma-separated values:
The scientific name of the plant species (string)
The minimum and maximum height of the plant in meters, separated by a hyphen (e.g., "1.5-2.0")
The bloom color of the plant (string)
Output Format:
For each plant species, output its details in the format:
Sample Input:
Rosaceae chinensis,0.5 - 1.2,pink
Sample Output:
Plant: Rosaceae chinensis
Height Range: 0.5 - 1.2 meters
Bloom Color: pink

Solution:
list=input().split(',')
print("Plant:",list[0])
print("Height Range:",list[1],"meters")
print("Bloom color:",list[2])
