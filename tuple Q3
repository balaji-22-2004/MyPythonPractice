You are a math teacher preparing a small program to help your students understand how tuples work in Python. You want to demonstrate how to create a tuple containing several numbers and then show them how to access a specific item from that tuple.
Input Format:
enter the index number to be found.
Note: predefined tuple consists of (10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100).
Output Format:
gives the value at the given index
Sample Input:
Enter the index of the number you want to access (0-9): 0
Sample Output:
The number at index 0 is: 10

Solution:
tup=(10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100)
n=int(input("Enter the index of the number you want to access (0-9):"))
if(0<=n<=9):
    print("The number at index",n,"is:",tup[n])
else:
    print("Invalid index. Please enter a number between 0 and 9")
