You are a curator for a small museum, and you maintain a digital catalog of artifacts. The catalog is stored as a tuple since the artifacts should not be frequently modified. However, when a new artifact is donated to the museum, you need to add it to the catalog. Given that tuples are immutable, you need to find a way to add this new artifact to the tuple.
Input Format:
enter the artifact to be added.
Output Format:
output shows the old and updated artifact(updated tuple).
Sample Input:
Enter the name of the new artifact to be added: Medieval Sword
Sample Output:
Initial catalog of artifacts: ('Ancient Vase', 'Old Coin', 'Rare Painting')
Updated catalog of artifacts: ('Ancient Vase', 'Old Coin', 'Rare Painting', 'Medieval Sword')

Solution:
tup1=('Ancient Vase', 'Old Coin', 'Rare Painting')
print("Enter the name of the new artifact to be added:")
new=input()
print("Initial catalog of artifacts:",tup1)
tup2=tup1+(new,)
print("Updated catalog of artifacts:",tup2)
