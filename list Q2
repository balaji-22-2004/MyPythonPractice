Imagine you're calculating the total bill for a grocery store order. You have a list containing the prices of different items you purchased. To find the total cost, you'll need to multiply all the individual prices. Lists in Python can store these prices, and a loop can help you efficiently calculate the product of all items.
Input Format:
An integer 'n' representing the number of items purchased.
A list of 'n' floating-point numbers, each representing the price of an item.
Output Format:
A single floating-point number representing the total cost (product of all item prices).
Sample input:
4
2.5 3.0 1.5 4.0
Sample Output:
45.0

Solution:
n=int(input())
list=input().split()
flist=[]
for i in list:
    flist.append(float(i))
mul=1
for i in flist:
    mul*=i
print("%.1f"%mul)
